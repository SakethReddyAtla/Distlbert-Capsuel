# Distlbert-Capsuel-neural-network
This project explores phishing URL detection using DistilBERT and Capsule Neural Networks. Evaluated on 277,645 real URLs, DistilBERT achieved 98% accuracy, while the Capsule Network only reached 50%. The Hybrid model showed slight improvements in recall, contributing valuable insights for future phishing detection research.
