# Phishing URL Detection using DistilBERT and Capsule Networks

## Overview
This project presents a novel approach to phishing URL detection by combining DistilBERT and Capsule Neural Networks. We evaluate three models—DistilBERT, Capsule Network, and a Hybrid model—using a dataset of 277,645 real-world URLs.

## Key Features
- **Model Evaluation**: Comparison of the performance of DistilBERT, Capsule Networks, and a Hybrid model.
- **Dataset**: Utilized a comprehensive dataset of 277,645 real-world URLs.
- **Performance Metrics**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score evaluated for each model.

## Results
- **DistilBERT**: Achieved an impressive accuracy of **98%**.
- **Capsule Network**: Showed limited effectiveness with an accuracy of only **50%**.
- **Hybrid Model**: Demonstrated slight improvements in recall.

## Contributions
This work contributes to the understanding of transformer-based models for URL classification and highlights challenges in applying Capsule Networks in security tasks. The findings provide insights for developing more sustainable and effective phishing detection systems.
